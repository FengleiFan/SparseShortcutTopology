# SparseShortcutTopology
This repository shows you the code regarding the paper (https://arxiv.org/abs/1811.09003), whose main contribution is to present a promising sparse shortcut topology for deep learning.

Please download and unzip the Tiny-ImageNet dataset from https://github.com/rmccorm4/Tiny-Imagenet-200, and then put my code in the same directory with the data. 
This code is established based on DenseNet implementation. 

For the code "topology_NTK_comparison.ipynb", you may want to open it through Colab, through which you do not need to configure the environment for JAX.
